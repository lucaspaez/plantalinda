# AI Model Configuration
# Change the model_name to use different pre-trained models from Hugging Face

# Current model: Plant disease detection
model_name: "linkanjarad/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224-plant-disease-identification"

# Alternative models you can try:
# model_name: "nateraw/vit-base-beans"  # Bean disease detection
# model_name: "Kaludi/food-category-classification-v2.0"  # General food/plant classifier
# model_name: "google/vit-base-patch16-224"  # General vision transformer

# You can also use custom models:
# 1. Train your own model on cannabis-specific data
# 2. Upload to Hugging Face
# 3. Put the model name here

# Model settings
confidence_threshold: 0.5
use_gpu: false  # Set to true if you have CUDA-capable GPU
